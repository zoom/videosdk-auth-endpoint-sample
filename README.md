# Zoom Video SDK Auth Endpoint sample

Use of this sample app is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://explore.zoom.us/en/video-sdk-terms/).

This is a Node.js / Express server that generates a [Video SDK JWT](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/auth/#generate-a-video-sdk-jwt) via an HTTP request for authorized use of the [Zoom Video SDK](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/).

If you would like to skip these steps and just deploy the finished code to a managed service, click the Deploy to Railway/Render/Heroku button. (You will still need to configure a few simple things, so skip to [Deployment](#deployment).)

| Railway | Render | Heroku |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/dO2hTU?referralCode=HTPdHX) | [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/zoom/videosdk-auth-endpoint-sample) | [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/zoom/videosdk-auth-endpoint-sample) | 

> Note: Both Railway and Render have free tiers, but Heroku requires a credit card to deploy.

## Installation

In terminal, run the following command to clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/zoom/videosdk-auth-endpoint-sample.git`

## Setup

1. In terminal, `cd` into the cloned repository:

   `$ cd videosdk-auth-endpoint-sample`

2. Then install the dependencies:

   `$ npm install`

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, edit the file contents to include your [Zoom Video SDK key and secret](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/get-credentials/), save the file contents, and close the file:

4. Start the server:

   `$ npm run start`

## Usage

Make a POST request to `http://localhost:4000` (or your deployed url) with the following request body:

| Property                 | Type     | Required? | Validation Rule(s)                                                                                           |

| `cloudRecordingElection` | `number` | No        | - Must equal `0` or `1`                                                                                      |
| `telemetryTrackingId`    | `string` | No        | N/A                                                                                                          |

### Audio Compatible Mode vs Audio WebRTC Mode

`audioWebRtcMode` replaces `audioCompatibleMode`, which is now deprecated. Update your code to use `audioWebRtcMode` going forward.

### Example Request

POST `http://localhost:4000`

Request Body:

```json
{
  "sessionName": "Cool Cars",
  "role": 1,
  "sessionKey": "session123",
  "userIdentity": "user123"
}
```

If successful, the response body will be a JSON representation of your signature:

```json
{
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHBfa2V5IjoiVklERU9fU0RLX0tFWSIsImlhdCI6MTY0NjI0ODc5NiwiZXhwIjoxNjQ2MjU1OTk2LCJ0cGMiOiJDb29sIENhcnMiLCJ1c2VyX2lkZW50aXR5IjoidXNlcjEyMyIsInNlc3Npb25fa2V5Ijoic2Vzc2lvbjEyMyIsInJvbGVfdHlwZSI6MH0.Y6C65mZUxTZFeGiOI6oW5q2UkIXe3nLTK0MVNkfiJ9c"
}
```

In the [Video SDK](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/auth/#start-and-join-sessions-with-the-video-sdk-jwt), pass in the `signature` to the `join()` function:

```js
// Make http request to your auth endpoint to get the Video SDK JWT

// Video SDK - web - example:

client.join(
   signature: signature,
   topic: sessionName,
   userName: userName,
   password: sessionPasscode
)
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to a Managed Service

1. After clicking the "Deploy to <Provider\>" button, enter a name for your app (or leave it blank to have a name generated for you), and insert your [Zoom Video SDK credentials](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/get-credentials/):

   - `ZOOM_VIDEO_SDK_KEY` (Your Zoom Video SDK Key, found on your Zoom Video SDK App's Credentials page)
   - `ZOOM_VIDEO_SDK_SECRET` (Your Zoom Video SDK Secret, found on your Zoom Video SDK App's Credentials page)

1. Then click "Deploy App".

1. Use your URL as your Video SDK Auth Endpoint.

   Example: `https://abc123.provider.com/`

```bash
$ curl <YOU_URL> -X POST -d '{  "sessionName": "Cool Cars",  "role": "1",  "sessionKey": "session123",  "userIdentity": "user123"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<!-- ### Heroku (CLI)

1. If you cloned this repository, you may use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) to deploy your server. Remember to [set your config vars (envoirnment variables)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

1. Use your Heroku URL as your Video SDK Auth Endpoint.

   Example: `https://abc123.herokuapp.com/` -->
   
### Other Server Hosting

1. For Other Server Hosting information, see [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/deployment#choosing_a_hosting_provider).

1. Use your deployed URL as your Video SDK Auth Endpoint.

   Example: `https://abc123.compute-1.amazonaws.com/`

Now you can [generate your Video SDK JWT](#usage).
